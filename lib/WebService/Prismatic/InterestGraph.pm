=head1 NAME

WebService::Prismatic::InterestGraph - identify topics in web page or text

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use WebService::Prismatic::InterestGraph;
 my $ig = WebService::Prismatic::InterestGraph->new( api_key => $key );
 my @tags = $ig->tag_url('http://perl.org');

 foreach my $tag (@tags) {
   printf " %s [score: %f]\n", $tag->topic, $tag->score;
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a simple interface to the Prismatic Interface Graph API,
which is an alpha service provided by L<prismatic.com|http://prismatic.com>.
It takes a piece of text and returns a number of tags, each of which
identifies a topic and a score for how likely the text includes that topic.
The text can either be specified via a URL, or passed as a scalar.

Before you can use the API, you must register with Prismatic to
get an I<api key>. One you've got that, you're ready to go.

Please note: because the service is in alpha,
you're currently restricted to 20 calls per minute.

Prismatic is a service which suggests things on the web that
you might be interested in reading.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

The constructor takes an C<api_key>:

 use WebService::Prismatic::InterestGraph;

 my $ig = WebService::Prismatic::InterestGraph->new( api_key => $key );

You can also pass an HTTP user agent with the C<ua> parameter,
but it pretty much has to be an instance of L<HTTP::Tiny>.

=head2 tag_url( $URL )

Takes a URL and analyses the text of the referenced page.
Returns a list of zero or more tags:

 @tags = $ig->tag_url('http://perl.org');

The tags are instances of L<WebService::Prismatic::InterestGraph::Tag>,
data objects with the following methods:

=over 4

=item * topic: short text giving the label for a topic, such as "open source"

=item * score: a number between 0 and 1 which says how likely it is that the text is actually about that topic.

=item * id: a unique integer identifier for the topic.

=back

=head2 tag_text( $TEXT [,$TITLE] )

Takes some text and an optional title string and returns a list of tags,
as for C<tag_url()> above:

 @tags = $ig->tag_url($body, $title);
